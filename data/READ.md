#### The data is: 
  "desc": an empty describtion

  "width_obs": width of obstacles as an array

  "dt": time step simulation 

  "partflow": part of the flow on a side of the total flow, 

  "people_per_second_per_meter": flow of agents per meter of total sides

  "stds": list of standard devision of simulations

  "obst": position of obstacles as an array

  "MS": time the simulation took for each agent

  "TT": side the agents were inizile on

  "C": the desired speed for the agents
